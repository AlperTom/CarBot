## Priority-Based Resolution Workflows

### P0 - CRITICAL: Emergency Response Protocol

#### Immediate Actions (Within 1 Hour)
1. **Auto-Assignment**

#### Resolution Phase (Hours 1-4)
4. **Emergency Development**
   - Single developer focus (no parallel work)
   - Minimal viable fix approach
   - Direct commits to main branch (if necessary)
   - Continuous stakeholder communication

5. **Emergency Testing**
   - Production-like environment testing
   - Core user journey validation
   - Basic smoke tests only
   - Risk assessment for deployment

6. **Hotfix Deployment**
   - Zero-downtime deployment if possible
   - Production monitoring dashboard active
   - Rollback plan ready and tested
   - Customer communication prepared

#### Post-Resolution (Hours 4-8)
7. **Validation & Monitoring**
   - End-to-end user journey testing
   - Revenue system functionality verification
   - Customer access rate monitoring
   - Error rate and performance metrics

8. **Communication & Documentation**
   - Customer notification (if needed)
   - Stakeholder status update
   - Incident post-mortem scheduling
   - Root cause analysis documentation
