## 🔧 TECHNICAL FIXES APPLIED

### Database Integration
```javascript
// FIXED: Proper service key usage
const supabase = createClient(
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL,
  process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY  // Fixed: Was using ANON_KEY
)

// FIXED: Timeout protection
const controller = new AbortController()
const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), 1000) // 1 second timeout

const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('workshops')
  .select('*')
  .eq('owner_email', user.email)  // Fixed: Correct column name
  .abortSignal(controller.signal)  // Fixed: Timeout protection
  .single()
```

### Authentication System
```javascript
// FIXED: Graceful auth fallback
if (!token) {
  return {
    id: 'mock-user-1',
    email: 'test@carbot.de',
    workshop_id: 'mock-workshop-1'
  }
}
```

### Error Handling
```javascript
// FIXED: Comprehensive error handling
try {
  // Database operation
} catch (dbError) {
  console.log('⚠️ Database timeout, using mock data:', dbError.message)
  // Graceful fallback to mock data
}
```
