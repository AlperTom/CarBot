## Key Features

### Limit Enforcement
- **Lead Creation**: Blocks creation when Basic users exceed 100/month
- **API Access**: Returns 402 Payment Required when Professional users exceed limits
- **Feature Gates**: Disables features not available in current package

### Usage Tracking
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Tracks leads, API calls, storage usage
- **Automatic Warnings**: Sends alerts at 80% and 95% usage
- **Billing Integration**: Records events for invoicing and notifications

### Security Features
- **API Key Hashing**: SHA-256 hashed storage, never store plain text
- **Rate Limiting**: Per-package and per-key rate limits
- **CORS Protection**: Origin-based access control
- **Audit Logging**: Complete trail of API key operations

### User Experience
- **Visual Indicators**: Progress bars, usage meters, warning states
- **Contextual Upgrades**: Smart upgrade suggestions based on usage
- **Graceful Degradation**: Features disable smoothly with clear messaging
- **German Localization**: All messages and pricing in German

## Database Schema Additions

### Tables Created
- `api_keys`: Secure API key management
- `api_key_usage`: Daily usage statistics per key
- `billing_events`: Usage warnings and notifications

### Columns Added
- `workshops.subscription_plan`: Current package identifier
- `workshops.monthly_leads_limit`: Package-specific limits
- `workshops.api_calls_limit`: API usage limits
- `leads.workshop_id`: Direct workshop relationship

### Functions Added
- `get_workshop_current_usage()`: Calculate current period usage
- `check_workshop_limit()`: Validate limits before operations

## Testing

Comprehensive test suite (`/tests/packageFeatures.test.js`) covering:
- Package limit enforcement
- Feature access validation
- Usage recording and warnings
- Error handling and edge cases
- Integration workflows for each package tier

## Integration Points

### Frontend
- Dashboard shows usage indicators and restrictions
- ChatWidget blocks lead creation at limits
- API key management interface for Professional+ users

### Backend
- All API endpoints check package limits
- Middleware tracks usage automatically
- Usage warnings sent via billing events

### Database
- Enterprise schema with performance optimizations
- Automated cleanup and retention policies
- Audit logging for compliance

## Security Considerations

### API Keys
- Never store plain text keys
- Implement per-key rate limiting
- Support key expiration and rotation
- Audit all key operations

### Usage Tracking
- Prevent manipulation of usage data
- Implement atomic operations
- Handle concurrent requests safely

### GDPR Compliance
- Automatic data retention policies
- User consent tracking
- Right to deletion support

## Deployment Notes

### Required Environment Variables
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://carbot.chat
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_key
```

### Database Migration
1. Run main enterprise schema
2. Execute `/database/package-features-migration.sql`
3. Verify test data creation

### Package Configuration
- Update Stripe price IDs in subscription_plans table
- Configure webhook endpoints for billing events
- Set up monitoring for usage warnings

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Key Metrics to Track
- Package conversion rates (Basic → Professional → Enterprise)
- Feature usage by package tier
- API key adoption and usage patterns
- Lead creation patterns and limits hit

### Recommended Alerts
- High Basic users approaching limits
- Failed API key authentications
- Unusual usage spikes
- Package downgrade attempts

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Usage-Based Billing**: Overage charges for Basic users
2. **Package Trials**: Time-limited access to higher tiers
3. **Usage Predictions**: ML-based limit forecasting
4. **Advanced Analytics**: Package-specific reporting dashboards

### Technical Debt
1. Move rate limiting to Redis for production scale
2. Implement distributed usage tracking
3. Add real-time usage WebSocket updates
4. Create admin interface for package management
