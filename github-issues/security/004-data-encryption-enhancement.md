# ðŸŽ¯ Enhancement: Advanced Data Encryption & Key Management System

## Business Impact
- **Revenue Impact**: â‚¬18,000-35,000 monthly - Military-grade encryption appeals to high-security workshops
- **Customer Value**: Complete data protection at rest and in transit with German encryption standards
- **Market Advantage**: Exceeds automotive industry encryption requirements

## Technical Specification
- **Implementation Approach**: 
  - Implement AES-256 encryption for all data at rest
  - Add end-to-end encryption for all data in transit
  - Build automated key rotation and management system
  - Create encrypted backup and disaster recovery system
- **Dependencies**: Hardware Security Module (HSM), key management service, encrypted storage
- **Complexity**: Medium (4-6 weeks)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] AES-256 encryption for all sensitive data at rest
- [ ] End-to-end encryption for all API communications and data transfer
- [ ] Automated key rotation with 90-day cycles
- [ ] Hardware Security Module (HSM) integration for key storage
- [ ] Encrypted database backups with separate key storage
- [ ] Field-level encryption for PII and sensitive customer data

## Success Metrics
- Encryption coverage: 100% of sensitive data
- Key rotation compliance: 100% automated
- Encryption performance impact: <5% overhead
