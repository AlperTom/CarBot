# ðŸŽ¯ Enhancement: API Security Hardening & Advanced Rate Limiting

## Business Impact
- **Revenue Impact**: â‚¬12,000-25,000 monthly - API security prevents costly breaches and enables B2B partnerships
- **Customer Value**: Robust API protection ensures reliable service and prevents abuse
- **Market Advantage**: Enterprise-grade API security for workshop integrations

## Technical Specification
- **Implementation Approach**: 
  - Implement advanced rate limiting with dynamic thresholds
  - Add API authentication with JWT refresh tokens and scope-based access
  - Build API abuse detection with machine learning algorithms
  - Create comprehensive API security monitoring and alerting
- **Dependencies**: API gateway, ML-based abuse detection, security monitoring tools
- **Complexity**: Medium (3-4 weeks)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Advanced rate limiting with per-user and per-endpoint thresholds
- [ ] JWT refresh token implementation with automatic rotation
- [ ] Scope-based API access control with granular permissions
- [ ] ML-powered API abuse detection with automatic blocking
- [ ] Comprehensive API security logging and monitoring
- [ ] API security dashboard with real-time threat detection

## Success Metrics
- API abuse incidents: 99% automatic detection and prevention
- API security response time: <30 seconds
- False positive rate: <1%
